## Notice

Sign-in with Google can works well in a development environment with Expo Go. However, it cannot get response successfully in an Android standalone. Thus, a fake user "Chan Tai Man" is used for the standalone cases. If you want to fully explore the functions provide by HKUFit, follow the instructions below

### Running with Expo
Node.js 16.13.0, git, Expo CLI, Yarn
Make sure you added Android Emulator to $PATH

Open a terminal and run
```
$ Yarn install
$ Yarn android
```
